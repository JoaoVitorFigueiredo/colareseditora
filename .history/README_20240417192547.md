## Wiki / Documentation

1. Make sure you clone our project with `git clone https://github.com/JoaoVitorFigueiredo/colareseditora.git && cd colareseditora`.

1. Please use `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Also install json-server package to run our local json database with `npm install -g json-server@0.17.4`.

NOTE: It's extremely necessary that you install v0.17.4. Main and latest version don't allow most search actions. Please make sure you execute the command above.

4. Now, you are ready to start: `npm start && json-server --watch db.json --port 3030`.

Note: If you have something already running in the ports in use of this project please change those in the package.json in the run script with `"start": "PORT=4000 react-scripts start"` for example. Default port is 3000 for React and for local db is 3030 (you can change that in the start watch command).
